# Fishbone by the Lake

## Rating: ★★★★☆

Food here is quite good, I'd say my family likes to go here in the summer primarily for the great vibes and great view along the shoreline. The first time we were here, we were our table wasn't ready, and we were seated in a cozy out door lounging area. Always a pleasant time (weather permitted). I believe they close if weather is poor, so I would check in advance before coming.
