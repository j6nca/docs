# Food

This space is to share my love of food. I plan to include recipes that I've made or am interested in trying, as well as reviews of restaurants I've been to.

## Map

I enjoy measuring and recording my own data day-to-day, here is a map of all the entries listed under the [[./reviews/index|review section]]
