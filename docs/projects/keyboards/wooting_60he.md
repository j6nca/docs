# Wooting 60HE

This is likely going to be my endgame keyboard. Hall-effect seems to be the future and until there is further innovation I don't think I will stray too far from this board (I may occassionally still build boards for the fun of it). Here's hoping that opensource keyboard firmware supports hall-effect switches soon ðŸ˜Š.
