# Keyboards

Here I discuss keyboards, including boards that I've purchased as well as boards I have designed from scratch. I also try to provide some buying [[keyboards/recommendations/index|recommendations]] for those in the market for a new keyboard.

## Custom builds

These are keyboards that I've built with.

### Wooting 60HE

This is likely going to be my endgame keyboard for the foresee-able. Hall-effect seems to be the bleeding edge of this input technology and until there is further innovation I don't think I will stray too far from this board (I may occasionally still build boards for the fun of it). Here's hoping that opensource keyboard software supports hall-effect switches soon ðŸ˜Š. List of mods (heavily inspired by [Optimum's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuULrGtbDy4)):

- Tofu60 Redux case
- Blank side-print shine-through keycaps (looks blank but has the option to light up just in case).
- Hand-lubed stock magnetic switches

### Epomaker TH40

This is the first 40% keyboard that I have purchased. It's a solid budget keyboard for those looking for a small form factor. Comes with a slightly thinner Wooting-style strap as well for the portable typists. With its gasket mounting and stock Wisteria linear switches, it sounds like a dream. The board also comes with VIA support making configuration a breeze to do on any machine.

After about a week of usage I can say this is a great 40% keyboard, but I haven't been able to commit fully to the layout. The reduced number of keys is isn't too bad thanks to the magic of layering, however the shift in placement of the `/?` and `fn` keys have made it less enjoyable for me. I'm sure with some remapping or more practice, one could really get attuned with this little beast.

### Iris rev. 8

An split ortho-linear keyboard.

## Designs

These are keyboards I've designed from the ground up. With new innovations in the hall-effect switch space, I am eager to work on new designs with these switches. Just waiting for someone to open source software for configuring these keyboards. ðŸ‘€
