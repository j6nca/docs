# j6n43 (WIP)

## Background

This document will outline the process I went through in building my very own pcb keyboard from scratch. Naturally, after designing a hand-wired keyboard, I wanted to jump into designing keyboard pcbs. During the handwiring process I was closely following many of Joe Scotto's resources, however, I was itching to make this keyboard and he hadn't released any resources in terms of pcb design yet. I decided to just jump in and try to learn things myself.

## Worklog

**Update 2023/07/19**
Made a new layout, inspired by existing [Alice layout](https://keychron.ca/products/keychron-q8-alice-layout-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard), keeping the small form factor of a 40% keyboard.

**Update 2023/07/20**
Working on designing schematic in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)

**Update 2023/07/23**
Placed my pcb order with [jlcpcb](https://jlcpcb.com/)
