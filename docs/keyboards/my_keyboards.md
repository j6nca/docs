# My keyboards

## Builds

These are keyboards that I've purchased and built with.

### Wooting 60HE

This is likely going to be my endgame keyboard for the foresee-able. Hall-effect seems to be the bleeding edge of this input technology and until there is further innovation I don't think I will stray too far from this board (I may occasionally still build boards for the fun of it). Here's hoping that opensource keyboard firmware supports hall-effect switches soon ðŸ˜Š. List of mods (heavily inspired by [Optimum's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuULrGtbDy4)):

- Tofu60 Redux case
- Blank side-print shine-through keycaps (looks blank but has the option to light up just in case).
- Hand-lubed stock magnetic switches

## Designs

These are keyboards I've designed from the ground up. With new innovations in the hall-effect switch space, I am eager to work on new designs with these switches. Just waiting for someone to open source software for configuring these keyboards. ðŸ‘€
