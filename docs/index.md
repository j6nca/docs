<h5>Zettelkasten</h5>

**\[[ Zet‧tel‧kas‧ten ](https://zettelkasten.de/)\]**

*(noun) system of small items of information stored on paper slips or cards, used for organizing knowledge and taking notes*

I've created this space as a second brain for myself to document and share my [[learning/index|notes]], love for [[food/index|food]], [[my_keyboards|keyboards]], [[projects/guitar|projects]], and hobbies. Hope you enjoy your stay!

This site is generated via [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). I use [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) to write and organize my notes.
